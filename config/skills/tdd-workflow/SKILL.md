# TDD Workflow

> Write tests first, code second.

---

## 1. The TDD Cycle

```
🔴 RED → Write failing test
    ↓
🟢 GREEN → Write minimal code to pass
    ↓
🔵 REFACTOR → Improve code quality
    ↓
   Repeat...
```

---

## 2. The Three Laws of TDD

1. Write production code only to make a failing test pass
2. Write only enough test to demonstrate failure
3. Write only enough code to make the test pass

---

## 3. RED Phase Principles

### What to Write

| Focus | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Behavior | "should add two numbers" |
| Edge cases | "should handle empty input" |
| Error states | "should throw for invalid data" |

### RED Phase Rules

- Test must fail first
- Test name describes expected behavior
- One assertion per test (ideally)

---

## 4. GREEN Phase Principles

### Minimum Code

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **YAGNI** | You Aren't Gonna Need It |
| **Simplest thing** | Write the minimum to pass |
| **No optimization** | Just make it work |

### GREEN Phase Rules

- Don't write unneeded code
- Don't optimize yet
- Pass the test, nothing more

---

## 5. REFACTOR Phase Principles

### What to Improve

| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| Duplication | Extract common code |
| Naming | Make intent clear |
| Structure | Improve organization |
| Complexity | Simplify logic |

### REFACTOR Rules

- All tests must stay green
- Small incremental changes
- Commit after each refactor

---

## 6. AAA Pattern

Every test follows:

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Arrange** | Set up test data |
| **Act** | Execute code under test |
| **Assert** | Verify expected outcome |

---

## 7. When to Use TDD

| Scenario | TDD Value |
|----------|-----------|
| New feature | High |
| Bug fix | High (write test first) |
| Complex logic | High |
| Exploratory | Low (spike, then TDD) |
| UI layout | Low |

---

## 8. Test Prioritization

| Priority | Test Type |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Happy path |
| 2 | Error cases |
| 3 | Edge cases |
| 4 | Performance |

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Skip the RED phase | Watch test fail first |
| Write tests after | Write tests before |
| Over-engineer initial | Keep it simple |
| Multiple asserts | One behavior per test |
| Test implementation | Test behavior |

---

## 10. AI-Augmented TDD

### Multi-Agent Pattern

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Agent A | Write failing tests (RED) |
| Agent B | Implement to pass (GREEN) |
| Agent C | Optimize (REFACTOR) |

---

> **Remember:** The test is the specification. If you can't write a test, you don't understand the requirement.

## ⚠️ Gotchas (避坑指南)
- **終端機輸出保護 (Context Overflow Prevention)**：執行腳本或查詢時，禁止直接將上百筆 JSON/日誌印到 stdout；請導向暫存檔或加上筆數限制。
- **優先使用確定性腳本**：遇到格式轉換、字數統計或合規檢查，優先調用 `scripts/` 下的 Python 工具，不要依賴純語意猜測。
